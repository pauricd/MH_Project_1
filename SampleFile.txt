Executed tests:
        As per assignment spec. 3 instances (inst-0.tsp, inst-13.tsp, inst-16.tsp) run against 6 Configurations (1-6) run 3 times.
            Population size = 100, Mutation Rate = 0.1 and Iterations = 300

Other Tests:
        - Increase Iterations count to 600
        - Decrease Iterations count to 100

        - Increase Mutation Rate to 0.4
        - Decrease Mutation Rate to 0.001

        - Increase Population Size to 400
        - Decrease Population size to 30

All these test cases have been able to run, and have yet to come across a situation where it would not run. I did do undocumented run of a Population size of 600 and it ran fine.

I am using a Windows 10 laptop with 32GB of Ram and an i7 processor @2.80GHz, 1TB SSD. So quite a good spec.
